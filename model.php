                <p>Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)34 takes cruising to the next level. Using forward-sensing radar technology and an intelligent camera, the system is designed to detect the speed and distance of the vehicle traveling directly ahead of you and adjust your speed accordingly, down to a complete stop. It works in light traffic as well, helping you maintain a preset following distance: slowing when the preset distance shortens, then accelerating back to your original cruising speed when the road clears ahead.
